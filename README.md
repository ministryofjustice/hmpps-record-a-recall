Template github repo used for new Typescript based projects.

# Instructions

If this is a HMPPS project then the project will be created as part of bootstrapping - 
see https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-project-bootstrap. You are able to specify a template application using the `github_template_repo` attribute to clone without the need to manually do this yourself within GitHub.

This bootstrap is community managed by the mojdt `#typescript` slack channel. 
Please raise any questions or queries there. Contributions welcome!

Our security policy is located [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-record-a-recall/security/policy). 

More information about the template project including features can be found [here](https://dsdmoj.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/NDSS/pages/3488677932/Typescript+template+project).

## Creating a Cloud Platform namespace

When deploying to a new namespace, you may wish to use this template typescript project namespace as the basis for your new namespace:

<https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments/tree/main/namespaces/live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/hmpps-record-a-recall>

### Auth Code flow

These are used to allow authenticated users to access the application. After the user is redirected from auth back to
the application, the typescript app will use the returned auth code to request a JWT token for that user containing the
user's roles. The JWT token will be verified and then stored in the user's session.

These credentials are configured using the following env variables:

- AUTH_CODE_CLIENT_ID
- AUTH_CODE_CLIENT_SECRET

### Client Credentials flow

These are used by the application to request tokens to make calls to APIs. These are system accounts that will have
their own sets of roles.

Most API calls that occur as part of the request/response cycle will be on behalf of a user.
To make a call on behalf of a user, a username should be passed when requesting a system token. The username will then
become part of the JWT and can be used downstream for auditing purposes.

These tokens are cached until expiration.

These credentials are configured using the following env variables:

- CLIENT_CREDS_CLIENT_ID
- CLIENT_CREDS_CLIENT_SECRET

### Dependencies

### HMPPS Auth

To allow authenticated users to access your application you need to point it to a running instance of `hmpps-auth`.
We use the dev instance of auth for this. 
It's common for developers to run against the instance of auth running in the development/T3 environment for
local development.
Most APIs don't have images with cached data that you can run with docker: setting up realistic stubbed data in sync
across a variety of services is very difficult.

### REDIS

When deployed to an environment with multiple pods we run applications with an instance of REDIS/Elasticache to provide
a distributed cache of sessions.
The template app is, by default, configured not to use REDIS when running locally.

## Running the app via docker-compose

The easiest way to run the app is to use docker compose to create the service and all dependencies.

`docker compose pull`

`docker compose up`

### Running the app for development
Create an environment file by copying `.env.example` -> `.env`
Environment variables set in here will be available when running `start:dev`

Install dependencies using `npm install`, ensuring you are using `node v24`

Note: Using `nvm` (or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm)), run `nvm install --latest-npm` within the repository folder
to use the correct version of node, and the latest version of npm. This matches the `engines` config in `package.json`
and the github pipeline build config.

And then, to build the assets and start the app with esbuild:

`npm run start:dev`

### Run linter

- `npm run lint` runs `eslint`.
- `npm run typecheck` runs the TypeScript compiler `tsc`.

### Run unit tests

`npm run test`

### Running integration tests

For local running, start a wiremock instance by:

`docker compose -f docker-compose-test.yml up`

Then run the server in test mode by:

`npm run start-feature` (or `npm run start-feature:dev` to run with auto-restart on changes)

After first install ensure playwright is initialised: 

`npm run int-test-init:ci`

And then either, run tests in headless mode with:

`npm run int-test`

Or run tests with the UI:

`npm run int-test-ui`

## Keeping your app up-to-date

While there are multiple ways to keep your project up-to-date this [method](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C69NWE339/p1694009011413449) doesn't require you to keep cherry picking the changes, however if that works for you there is no reason to stop.

In your service, add the template as a remote:

`git remote add template https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-template-typescript`

Create a branch and switch to it, eg:

`git checkout -b template-changes-2309`

Fetch all remotes:

`git fetch --all`

Merge the changes from the template into your service source:

`git merge template/main --allow-unrelated-histories`

You'll need to manually handle the merge of the changes, but if you do it early, carefully, and regularly, it won't be too much of a hassle.

## Change log

A changelog for the service is available [here](./CHANGELOG.md)
